# Harry-Potter-Invisible-Cloak
I am a potterhead and made this project for entertainment purpose :)
Run this program in your system and move aside infront of webcam for 3 seconds; and then cover a thing with a red cloth and it will make that thing invisible.
It basically captures the background in the first three seconds and then removes anything coloured RED from the recording post capturing the background shot.
You can change the colour in the code.
HAVE FUN!:)
